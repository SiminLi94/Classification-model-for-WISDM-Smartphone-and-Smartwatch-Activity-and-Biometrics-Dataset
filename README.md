# Classification-model-for-WISDM-Smartphone-and-Smartwatch-Activity-and-Biometrics-Dataset
This project introduces several methods and results of finding a good classification model for WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset.
## Introduction
The smartphone dataset consists of fitness 18 different activities recordings of 51 people captured through smartphone enabled with inertial sensors. The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can precisely identify human fitness activities.
